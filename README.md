# siam

## brief

This repo contains suplementary code for my bachelor diploma @ NUST MISIS.

## in particular

`src` contains 3 files:
- `data.py` - useful utilities for data preparation
- `net.py` - base network + some ops
- `siam.py` - training of siamese net

## credits

The siamese part is based on Keras siamese MNIST example:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_siamese_graph.py

## future plans

It's very likely (as I'm willing to grad the next month) that there will be frequent commits here.
Feel free to use my workarounds. -btlk
